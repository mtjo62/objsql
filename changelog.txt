Summary: objSQL 3.5.0 released


* Removed obj_driver() method. The info was moved the obj_info() method. ( obj_info()['DATABASE_DRIVER'] )
* Updated internal datasource method to only require the database type, ( ie: mysql,sqlite,etc. )
  in the connection string/array. Backwards compatible with prior versions using the pdo:dbtype string.
  This eliminates the need to recheck for dbtype throughout the PDO classes.
* Drivers abstracted to their own directory.
* Script attempts to load PDO drivers first and defaults to normal drivers if not enabled.
* Some code and docs refactored for "best coding practices".
* Verified compatibility with SQL Server 14 Express.
* Verified compatibility with PHP 5.6 Beta: MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, PostgreSQL and Oracle PDO.

Summary: objSQL 3.0.0 released

* DB connection, statement, resultset and transaction drivers were encapsulated into
  a single script for each database driver.
* Sequence methods were dropped.
* Support dropped for Oracle, Sybase, DB2, Ingres, Firebird, MaxDB, Sybase, SQLite2
  and SQL Server 2000/2003 servers.
* Added support for the MariaDB server.
* SQL Server DB type argument for datasource array changed from mssql to sqlsrv.
* All public methods were prepended with "obj_". This was done to help avoid collisions
  with methods from other libraries and to aid in code maintenance.
* Added prepared statement classes.
* Three public methods were renamed:

      fetch_array() -> obj_fetch_assoc()
      fetch_row()   -> obj_fetch_num()
      flush()       -> obj_free_result()

* Public methods added:

      obj_autocommit_mode()
      obj_error()
      obj_error_message()
      obj_escape()
      obj_paging()
      obj_close_statement()
      obj_free_statement()
      obj_prepare_statement()

* Updated and optimized statement and resultset classes.
* SQLite 3 now emulates num_rows() and fetch_object() without additional queries by
  utilizing the resultset resource.

Notes:

This version, 3.0.0, breaks previous versions. This is due to the renaming of
public methods and dropped database support. It is recommended to use this version
with new projects.

Summary: objSQL 2.0.0 released

* Added helper methods: insert(), delete(), select(), update() and server_version()
* DB connection, transaction and sequence methods were encapsulated and classed for
  each particular database driver
* getGenerator() and setGenerator() methods were removed - sequence() and create_sequence()
  are now used exclusively
* Many public methods were renamed in the standard PHP syntax:

      setSequence()  -> create_sequence()
      getSequence()  -> sequence()
      disconnect()   -> close()
      connectionID() -> connection()
      resultID()     -> result()
      execute()      -> query() - non-prepared query
      affectedRows() -> affected_rows()
      numRows()      -> num_rows()
      numFields()    -> num_fields()
      nextRow()      -> fetch_array() - assoc array resultset
      nextRow(true)  -> fetch_row() - numeric array resultset
      nextObject()   -> fetch_object()
      getField()     -> field()

* Updated conditionals in the public limit() and offset() methods and the private
  setSequence() method to verify the argument is_numeric and casts as a true unsigned integer.
  The bind() method was also updated to verify that a numeric argument is not treated as a
  string value. This caused errors with $_POST numeric data in Sybase and DB2. The check was added
  to all database drivers as a precaution.
* Transaction methods now return a bool/resource for exception handling
* Updated error handling in all classes where a native query was used

Notes:

This version, 2.0.0, breaks previous versions. This is mainly due to the renaming of public methods.
It is recommended to use this version with new projects.

Summary: objSQL 1.3.0 released

* Added support for Ingres, MaxDB and Sybase ASE
* Added sequence support for DB2 and PostgreSQL

Notes:

This version adds the methods sequence() and setSequence() to replace generator() and
setGenerator(). generator() and setGenerator() was kept as an alias for backwords
compatibility. Minor bugfix in the mysqlResultset class to fix incorrect connection ID
in error function.

Summary: objSQL 1.2.0 released

* Renamed the class datasource to objSQL
* Added the method datasource() to handle the database connection/validation in extended
  classes.

Notes:

This minor release breaks previous versions. The main reason for this was the inability
to easily extend objSQL. See objSQL_1.2.0_docs.zip for usage.

Summary: objSQL 1.1.0 released

* Added support for the IBM DB2 database server
* Enabled transaction support for SQLite
* Changed the $this->nextRow() methods to require a true argument to return numeric
  indices for all database types

Notes:

objSQL ver. 1.1.0 adds support for IBM's DB2 database server
and transaction of SQLite. This minor release breaks previous
versions. The main reason for this was with the addition of DB2,
the $this->nextRow() method would require the true argument for
numeric indexes. For the sake of a consistent interface, all
database types now require this argument. The $this->numRows()
method for Firebird/Interbase, Oracle and DB2 require a
"SELECT count(*)..." statement to return true numrows functionality.
SQLite does not support savepoints and utilizes an "all or nothing"
approach.

* The mssqlResultset driver had a strtoupper function in the getField() method and this
  was removed. Still not sure why it was even there. This has been updated in the downloads.
